# NerdleMaster
A tool which allows the user to quickly identify potential solutions when playing Nerdle.

Note that this tool also includes a Python 3 program which generates all of the possible equations that can be fit within the parameters of the Nerdle game.  Since Python provides a built-in mechanism for evaluting a string as a mathematical expression, it was used instead of Java for that purpose. I have included that program's output, nerdle.txt, which contains the list of equations, one-per-line.

This tool has been used most extensively in macOS (v12.4) but has also been tested in Windows and Linux, and works well in those operating systems as well.  Note that a JAR file can be built by executing buildNerdleMaster. Note that you will need to have nerdle.txt in the same directory as the JAR file.
